# Multiple-Linear-Regression-2-Way-ANOVA

This repository is about using 2 statistical techniques both from the GLM (General Linear Models) family, namely, Multiple Linear Regression and Two Way ANOVA. We will use these methods to explore and make inferences about 2 data sets of interest. 

* **kmL** Data Set: this data set is used for our Two Way Analysis of Variance test and is about how different drivers and car types influence the fuel consumption/efficiency.
* **surg** Data Set: this data set is about the survival time of patients following a specific liver surgery and different variables regarding them.

**Languages Used** : R and Latex.  
**Packages Used** : ggplot2, dplyr, GGally, knitr.   
**Format/Structure of Analysis**: The pdf document can be broken down into 2 distinct parts with sub sections for both.
